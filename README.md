# Jamal-s-Banked-TTS-Voice

I banked my voice so that it can be used on computers. Supports Windows & Mac native TTS engine. I wanted to donate my voice to people with disabilities since they are unable to speak, additionally there is a limited selection of voices available for them. 

My voice is available for Windows, Microsoft Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10. My voice is compatible with Microsoft SAPI5 applications, and appear in the Windows Text-to-Speech Control Panel. My voice is 48khz for excellent clarity and naturalness.My voice also works with Apple Mac OS X: 10.7 Lion, 10.8 Mountain Lion, 10.9 Mavericks, 10.10 Yosemite, 10.11 El Capitan and 10.12 Sierra. 

I've released my voice until the MIT license, feel free to use it for whatever you like.
